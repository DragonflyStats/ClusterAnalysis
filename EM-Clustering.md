The EM Algorithm
====================================================
The EM algorithm for clustering is described in detail in Witten and Frank (2001). 
The basic approach and logic of this clustering method is as follows: 
- Suppose you measure a single continuous variable in a large sample of observations. 
- Further, suppose that the sample consists of two clusters of observations with different means (and perhaps different standard deviations); within each sample, the distribution of values for the continuous variable follows the normal distribution.
